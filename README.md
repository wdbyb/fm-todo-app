## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass 7-1
- BEM
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

React app with simple state + basic hooks (useState, useEffect). Distinguish components in app and a bit deeper understanding of Vite + React.

### Continued development

SVGs and images adding as imports in app is a not great idea. Having bad understanding of components with state and without. Definitely want to give a try to Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources

- [SVGs with Vite](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-import-svgs-in-react-and-vite/) - SVGs and static images in Vite + React.
- [Vite Plugin Compression](https://morioh.com/p/0a37d5cf2171) - Use gzip or brotli to compress resources.
